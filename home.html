              <p class="light">Hi, I'm Jessica! I love learning new technologies, reading fiction, watching anime, and traveling. I am the perfect fit for this role because I have spent nearly my entire adult life working in hospitality and customer service. Additionally, I just graduated from Wyncode, Miami's 9-week immersive bootcamp for web development and software engineering.

              <p class="light">Currently, I work for a children's soccer program, and there have been plenty occasions where I need to tell a parent "no". We try to avoid this and instead guide them to a better solution. For example, we often have parents who request to be squeezed into a full class for one reason or another. To maintain the quality of the program we cannot exceed the class capacity. Rather than rejecting the request flat out, I like to propose alternatives. That way they still have the power to choose while also matching our company's policy. A sort of compromise that makes everyone happy.

                <p class="light">I do not believe the customer, nor anyone, is always right. I do believe <i>they</i> believe they are right, so I always try to approach a situation with empathy and understanding. It's simply a matter of explaining and helping them understand you as well. You don't tell people "NO, because it's policy." You explain to them why the policy or rule is in place and how it helps them too, ultimately.

                <p class="light">Customers can have a lot of really valuable insights on how our product is used and how it can be improved. It's important to acknowledge this, especially if it's a feature we would like to implement.<br><br>
                  My response:
                  Hi _______,
                  We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. It's important to us to know what the community is interested in. [<i>FEATURE</i>] isn't something we currently offer, however, we do have some other exciting features on our plate that you might find to be useful, like [<i>X, Y, Z</i>].<br><br>
                  I would offer solutions that are similar to what they are looking for, and that are unique to our brand. If the feature is something in the works, I would make that clear in the response.

                <p class="light">Customer Support Specialists are on the front lines, and often bear the brunt of distraught or unhappy customers. So how we handle these moments are crucial. <br><br>
                  Entering this kind of scenario, the first thing to do would be to troubleshoot where the issue is coming from and what's causing it to happen. With a better understanding of the issue, I can then decide if it's within my realm of capabilities to resolve or if I need to reach out to the appropriate department or supervisor. Next would be to face the customers! This is an important part that has to be handled perfectly. I would apologize sincerely, sympathize and accept responsibility. As an ambassador for the company, a customer service team has to take responsibility for a customer's unhappiness, whether it is their fault or not. Finally, I would inform them of the steps we are taking to fix the problem.

                    <p class="light">I'm currently using my latest purchase right now to build this website and it rocks! I just grabbed a 15-inch MacBook Pro 2.2GHz Quad-core Intel i7 with Retina Display. This was a pretty big purchase for me and I did a lot of research before committing. I narrowed down my search to a Mac because as a writer, designer and now developer, it has a ton of built-in tools with the creative professionals in mind, like the Console, Terminal, great UI and UX and so much more. <br><br>
                    I knew from the start that my budget could only afford a refurbished laptop. After talking to my peers, I checked Newegg and Apple to compare prices. I knew the processing speeds would be important for my development so it came down to 'how much bang for my buck' I could swing.
